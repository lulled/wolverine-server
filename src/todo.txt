Looking at your current code structure, it would likely struggle with handling 10,000 concurrent connections without some significant modifications. Here are the key issues that would affect scalability:

Single-threaded execution - Node.js is single-threaded by default, so while it can handle many connections through its event loop, CPU-intensive operations would become bottlenecks.
No connection pooling - Your MongoDB connections don't appear to implement connection pooling, which would be essential for handling large numbers of simultaneous database operations.
Missing caching - There's no caching implementation, meaning every request hits your database directly.
No load balancing - The server doesn't have any horizontal scaling capabilities or load balancing configuration.
Limited error handling for high-load scenarios - Your error handling doesn't account for timeout scenarios or connection limits that would occur under high load.

To handle 10K connections, you would need to:

Implement clustering to utilize multiple CPU cores
Add a robust caching layer (like Redis)
Configure proper database connection pooling
Set up horizontal scaling with load balancing
Implement rate limiting and queue systems for traffic spikes
Add monitoring and auto-scaling capabilities
Optimize your database queries and indexes
